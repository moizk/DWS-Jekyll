    <p>Designed specifically for the craft beer market, DWS Printing has debuted their new 100% post-consumer recycled, wet-strength label paper. Trademarked Legacy Label™, the 51 lb. paper is manufactured using 100% renewable electricity through a combination of direct low-impact hydroelectric and purchased wind power energy credits. It is also manufactured carbon neutral.</p>
    <p>"Craft brewers are committed to make sure their packaging has minimal impact on the environment and our Legacy Label™ gives them a new way to take that commitment to the next level," said DWS partner, Andy Staib. "While certain brewers have successfully 'greened' their packaging by using post-consumer content in their six-packs and corrugated, labels have traditionally been made using only virgin fiber. We are bringing an alternative option to the table — a label paper that is made from 100% post-consumer recycled fiber and is still water resistant."</p>
    <p>Legacy Label™ is an uncoated label paper that provides a more natural look and feel than conventional gloss coated labels, while its bright whiteness still ensures accurate color representation on press</p>
    <p>Whether you're creating an organic product line or simply wish to reflect a sense of eco-consciousness, Legacy Label™ is the natural choice.</p>
