    <p>Designed with the craft beer and natural & organic markets in mind and made from 100% Post-Consumer Recycled fiber, DWS Printing proudly introduces Legacy Label&reg;</p>
    <p>This 51 lb. Wet-Strength label paper is manufactured carbon neutral using 100% renewable electricity through a combination of direct low-impact hydroelectric and purchased wind power energy credits. Legacy Label paper provides a more natural look and feel than conventional gloss coated labels, while its bright whiteness still ensures accurate color representation on press.</p>
    <p>Craft brewers and those in the natural & organic channels are committed to making sure their packaging has minimal impact on the environment and our Legacy Label&reg; gives them a new way to take that commitment to the next level.  While certain clients have successfully 'greened' their packaging by using post-consumer content in their secondary packaging, primary product labels have traditionally been made using only virgin fiber. We are bringing an alternative option to the table â€” a label paper that is made from 100% Post-Consumer Recycled fiber and still water resistant.</p>
    <p>Whether you're creating an organic product line or simply wish to reflect a sense of eco-consciousness, Legacy Label&reg; is the natural choice.</p>
