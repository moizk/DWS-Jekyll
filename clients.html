          <p>They say "good things come to those who wait", and so it was with Apple & Eve.  It took 9 years of persistence and patience from Andy Staib before DWS got its first order from Apple & Eve. We've been there for them ever since - 14 straight years.  They continue to be one of DWS' largest, most valuable, and loyal clients to this day.</p>
