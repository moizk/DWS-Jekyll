        <h2 class="text-center">Brooklyn Brewery</h2>
        <p>One of DWS' fastest growing craft brewing partners, Brooklyn Brewery continues to push the envelope with super innovative labels that include metallized papers, embossing patterns and unique "out of the box" designs. </p>
        <h5>Fun Fact</h5>
        <p><blockquote>DWS and Brooklyn Brewery share some common roots in that the brewery, located at 79 N. 11th Street is located only blocks away from where DWS operated from 1920 through 1965 on Berry and S. 5th Street.  Come on down to the brewery and have a pint or two.  Better yet, have a bottle or two. (the bottles have those cool labels on them, after all...)</blockquote></p>
        <h5>Label Specs</h5>
        <p><small>Lager, Hand & Seal & Local 1- printed on silver metallized paper using UV-cured PMS inks.  Blast - printed on white semi-gloss with custom UV-cured PMS inks.</small></p>

          <p>They say "good things come to those who wait", and so it was with Apple & Eve.  It took 9 years of persistence and patience from Andy Staib before DWS got its first order from Apple & Eve.  That's right, 9 years!  And guess what.....we screwed up that first order.  But, they gave us a chance to make it right, and so we did.  And we've been making it right for Apple & Eve for the past 14 straight years.  They continue to be one of DWS' largest, most valuable and loyal clients to this day.  They are the epitome of the word business "partners."</p>

          <h4>Smucker's</h4>
          <p>The JM Smucker Company certainly shares a common theme with DWS - namely its multigenerational heritage and 100+ year commitment to its founder's vision.  Although Smuckers is undeniably an industry giant today, they still treat their supply chain with the same mutual respect and consideration that Jerome Monroe Smucker himself exhibited when the company was founded in 1897.  JMS & DWS..... opposite in size, identical in values.</p>
