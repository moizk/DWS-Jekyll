        <p class="team-bio-big">Tom Staib lives and breathes DWS Printing, it's that simple. Along with the help & support of his brother & partner Andy, Tom continues to take DWS to the next level, building the DWS team by getting (with?) the right people "on the bus", by reinvesting in new technology and by maintaining DWS' relationships with its clients.  Never shy to work Saturdays or Sundays, Tom can be found doing everything from flying "across the pond" to Europe exploring new printing equipment to helping our Finishing Department by lending a hand packing boxes.  Tom not only leads the team, but he is embedded IN the team.  He attended The Hill School in Pottstown, PA and he graduated from Villanova with a B.S. in Finance.  Tom is married with two children and he enjoys boating, fishing and cooking almost anything on a Weber grill or smoker.</p>

        <p class="team-bio-big">Andy Staib, 4th-Generation Owner... like his brother & partner Tom, Andy wears many hats at DWS but his primary responsibility is to drive sales with the DWS Sales Team.   He promotes a Face-to-Face selling strategy to the team.  As "the outside guy" and the face of DWS, you'll likely see Andy proudly wearing one of his DWS golf shirts at one of the many trade shows he attends.  Andy's role is similar to that of his father Allen - who ran the business from 1961-1996 - in that he is both an owner and a proud salesman.  He understands the needs of his clients and he also appreciates what is involved in the art of label making.  Andy attended Canterbury School in New Milford, CT and he has a B.A. from Providence College.  Married and father of 3 teenage daughters, Andy enjoys his family, golf, exercise, craft beer and live music.</p>
