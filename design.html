        <hr>
        <p class="lead">Benjamin H. Owens III is an artist.</p>
        <p>He is also DWS' Creative Director and our favorite secret weapon. A graduate of R.I.T with a Dual Degree in Illustration and Art History, Ben sees the world differently, making him a rare partner in brand design. His vision is often the catalyst that can transform a label into an invitation to try the experience within that glass bottle.</p>
        <p>Much of this insight is derived from his seemingly endless reserves of energy. Always creating, he is a former gilder & carver for the world famous Sotheby's auction house and his paintings have been featured in <a href="http://www.juxtapoz.com/" target="_blank">Juxtapoz Magazine</a> and collected by people such as: Peter Max and Mark Ryden. Ben is also the <a href="http://www.dwsprinting.com/images/stories/demo/pdfs/owens_pabst_winner.pdf" target="_blank">National Award Winner for the Pabst Blue Ribbon Contest</a> and has been garnered the title of <a href="http://www.dwsprinting.com/images/stories/demo/pdfs/owens_artist_vip.pdf" target="_blank">Long Island's VIP Artist by Pulse Magazine</a> - no big deal. </p>
        <p>We love being able to offer his talent as a resource to our clients - from labels, to cartons, to point of sale materials, we can help you create an experience that will compel customers and convey your unique story.</p>

What does that have to do with Cider? Well ... nothingm but neither does the fact that Annie loved cider more than Bill.</p>
