  <h3 class="text-center">Our Story</h3>
  <p>In 1865, Abraham Lincoln was in office, The Civil War was ending, and David Weil was starting up a lithographic company in New York City. Soon after, our great-grandfather, Charles Staib became a principal managing partner, and the rest is history.</p>
  <p>150 years later, here we are - fourth generation owners committed to keeping the legacy alive. Committed to the pioneers who came before us, to always be at the forefront, mastering our craft and using our own hearts, minds, and hands to create greatness.</p>
  <p>We are the last step in the visions of a lot of passionate people. We take an anonymous container and provide its story. We become a part of so many stories in what we do. It’s what makes our story so vibrant.</p>
  <p>Our purpose is to help actualize your vision, to help tell your story, and to become a part of <i>your</i> legacy.</p>

        <p>When we proudly introduced our Legacy Label<span>&reg;</span>, we built our character into its very fibers - one of resilience and consciousness. Made from 100% Post-Consumer Recycled fiber, this 51 lb. Wet-Strength label paper is manufactured carbon neutral using 100% renewable electricity through a combination of direct low-impact hydroelectric and purchased wind power energy credits.</p>
