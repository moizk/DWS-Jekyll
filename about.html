  <h3 class="text-center">Our Story</h3>
  <p>In 1865, Abraham Lincoln was in office, The Civil War was ending and Daniel Weis was starting up a lithograph company in New York City. Soon after, our great-grandfather, Charles Staib became a principal managing partner and the rest is history.</p>

  <p>We are the last step in the visions of a lot of passionate people. We take an anonymous container and provide its story. We become a part of so many stories in what we do. Itâ€™s what makes our story so vibrant.</p>
  <p>Our mission is to help actualize your vision, to help tell your story, to become a part of your legacy.</p>
