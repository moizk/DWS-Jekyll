  <p><a href="http://whattheythink.com/news/70975-dws-puts-competition-rearview-mirror-heidelberg-xl-106/" target="_blank">Our Heidelberg XL 106 8 Color UV Press is the first of its kind in the United States.</a> With run speeds of up to 18,000 sheets per hour, it has more than doubled our capacity.</p>
  <p>The press is equipped with the two most sophisticated color control technology systems on the market today - InPress Color Management and Axis Control. This closed loop system measures ink densities as well as <a href="http://www.heidelberg.com/corp/www/binaries/bin/files/dotcom/en/prinect/user_guide_colorimetry_en.pdf">L* a* b*</a> values - a more advanced way of measuring color -  and compares those values to the approved standard, automatically adjusting the ink levels to maintain consistency, even at speeds of 18,000 sheets per hour. This means we can ensure all your labels will look just as vibrant, from the first sheet to the last, and you can trust your repeat orders to have the same level of consistency.</p>
  <p>We also launched HD-7 Series®, expanded gamut 7/color process printing, and we are <a href="http://www.idealliance.org/certifications/g7-certifications/g7-system-certification">G7 Certified</a> in this technology. This process introduces 3 additional colors, Orange, Green + Violet,  to the standard 4/color ink series, allowing for more vibrant illustrations and photography by color matching nearly 90% of all Pantone colors - maybe that explains all the awards our HD-7 labels have been winning in the industry. So bring on your most intricate designs, we’re ready.</p>

  <div class="text-center">

  <br><br>
  <p>In February 2015, we installed our brand new Omet X6 10-Color flexographic press – which we fondly refer to as <i>Beauty</i>.  We choose Omet, the leading flexographic printing press manufacturer in the world, because the Italian-made equipment boasts the most technologically advanced registration system on the market today.</p>
  <p>Beauty is specifically engineered for printing on unsupported substrates, so in addition to our Cut + Stack and Pressure Sensitive label capabilities, we are now fully ready to take on the growing Shrink Sleeve and Roll Fed label marketplace. Our new investments in technology also include a 100% inspection system that will detect defects smaller than a pinhole - even at speeds of 1,800 feet per minute - crazy, we know.</p>
  <p>These new additions afford us the opportunity to create more possibilities and solutions with our clients - we are looking forward to how we can make your next project revolutionary.</p>
