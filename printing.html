  <p><a href="http://whattheythink.com/news/70975-dws-puts-competition-rearview-mirror-heidelberg-xl-106/" target="_blank">Our Heidelberg XL 106 8 Color UV Press is the first of its kind in the United States.</a> With run speeds of up to 18,000 sheets per hour, it has more than doubled our capacity.</p>
  <p>The press is equipped with the two most sophisticated color control technology systems on the market today - InPress Color Management and Axis Control. This closed loop system measures ink densities as well as <a href="http://www.heidelberg.com/corp/www/binaries/bin/files/dotcom/en/prinect/user_guide_colorimetry_en.pdf" target="_blank">L* a* b*</a> values and compares those values to the approved standard, automatically adjusting the ink levels to maintain consistency, even at speeds of 18,000 sheets per hour. This means we can assure all your labels will look just as vibrant, from the first sheet to the last, and you can trust your repeat orders to have same level of consistency. </p>
  <p>We also launched HD-7 Series<span>&reg;</span>, expanded gamut 7/color process printing, and we are <a href=" http://www.idealliance.org/certifications/g7-certifications/g7-system-certification" target="_blank">G7 Certified</a> in this technology. This process introduces 3 additional colors - Orange, Green, Violet -to the standard 4/color ink series, allowing for more vibrant illustrations and photography by color matching nearly 90% of all Pantone colors. So bring on your most intricate designs, we’re ready.</p>
