  <h3 class="text-center">Cut + Stack</h3>
  <p>Our Heidelberg XL 106 8 Color UV Press is the first of its kind in the United States. With run speeds of up to 18,000 sheets per hour, it has more than doubled our capacity.</p>
  <p>The press is equipped with the two most sophisticated color control technology systems on the market today - InPress Color Management and Axis Control. This closed loop system auto corrects any color deviation both within the run and by referring to preset stored ink densities, therefore eliminating variation from one run to the next.</p>
  <p>We also launched HD-7 Series, expanded gamut 7/color process printing. This process introduces 3 additional colors (Orange, Green, Violet) to the standard 4/color ink series, allowing for more vibrant illustrations and photography as well as color matching of nearly 90% of all Pantone colors.</p>
  <p>Here are some of our Cut + Stack/Glue Applied go-to solutions:</p>
