  <p><a href="http://whattheythink.com/news/70975-dws-puts-competition-rearview-mirror-heidelberg-xl-106/">Our Heidelberg XL 106 8 Color UV Press is the first of its kind in the United States.</a> With run speeds of up to 18,000 sheets per hour, it has more than doubled our capacity.</p>
  <p>The press is equipped with the two most sophisticated color control technology systems on the market today - InPress Color Management and Axis Control. The press automatically adjusts the ink levels to maintain consistency, even at speeds of 18,000 sheets per hour. This assures virtually no color deviation within the run or on repeat orders.</p>
  <p>We also launched HD-7 Series<span>&reg;</span>, expanded gamut 7/color process printing, and we are G7 Certified. This process introduces 3 additional colors (Orange, Green, Violet) to the standard 4/color ink series, allowing for more vibrant illustrations and photography as well as color matching of nearly 90% of all Pantone colors.</p>
